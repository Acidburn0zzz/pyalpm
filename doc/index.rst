Pyalpm documentation
=====================

Pyalpm is a python package that provides you native bindings to both libalpm
and pacman. If you need to interact with alpm databases or programatically call
pacman in a safe, sensible way, you're in the right place.


Package structure
-----------------

Pyalpm exposes two python modules: alpm (python bindings libalpm) and pycman (a
python module exposing pacman functionalities).
